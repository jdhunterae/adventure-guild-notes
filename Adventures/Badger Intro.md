After retrieving your payment from the village elder, and donating some of it back to help pay for the repair and revitilization of the village, you find yourselves gathered in the town square of [[Lamaltee]]. There are several makeshift cots scattered around the intersection of paths behind the Grand Tree. Most of the village has gathered around to tend to the unconcious children.

As the sun begins to set over the small elven village, the thick black smoke of the [[Gulithais Tree]]'s fire causing the sunset to be extra vibrant as it dips behind the tree-line, the quiet streets are suddenly interrupted by a loud rumbling sound. The ground beneath your feet starts to shake and split open, revealing five massive dire badgers bursting out from the earth. The villagers scream and scatter in panic as the beasts charge towards them, their razor-sharp claws glinting in the fading light.

The dire badgers are huge, easily twice the size of a regular badger, and their thick fur bristles as they snarl and growl. Their eyes are bloodshot and wild, and drool drips from their gaping maws as they rush towards you and your party.

You have only a split second to react before the badgers reach you. Each of the badgers swings it's head about while their wild eyes track the screaming and fleeing villagers.

As the largest of them sets eyes on your party, the panicked screams of the villagers ring through the forest. You and your party must act fast to protect the innocent and defeat the beasts before they can cause any more destruction. Roll initiative.
