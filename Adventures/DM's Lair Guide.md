## Storyline

Pandas find themselves in a strange forest. The help Onver and Shalana against the plant blights, and escort them back to Lamaltee. Their parents are very grateful and reward them. The heroes meet with Aelrindell and Nasair to discuss the evil plants. Aelrindell asks them to find out what's going on. In exchange, she will see what can be done to help the pandas get back to their home.

## Locations

### Lamaltee

An elven village in the Sharp Teeth Wood.

## NPCs

### Avandith Stargazer

Elven druid who has been corrupted by the Gulithais Tree in the Sharp Teeth Wood. *Motivation*: spread the power of the Gulithais Tree throughout the forest and corrupt all living beings by feeding them a drink made from the sap in the blisters of the Gulithias Tree. *Means*: uses blights, her own magic, and deception to capture elves from Lamaltee and corrupt them.

### Gulithias Tree

Evil tree that originated from all the blood of a vampire named Gulithias. Its evil spreads through the soil of a forest, eventually corrupting all plants and animals in the forest.

### Onver Sourdirt

Male elven adolescent (35 years old). Child of Kurtice and Haurisha Sourdirt. Somewhat timid, a quiet troublemaker, quick to flee from problems.

### Shalana Oakbow

Female elven adolescent (33 years old). Child of Abigail Oakbow. Strong willed, boastful, believes she can do anything.

## Random Encounters

- **2 Skeletons** (easy, 150 AXP, 100 XP)
- **5 Blood Hawks** (medium, 250 AXP, 125 XP)
- **1 Giant Constrictor Snake** (medium, 450 AXP, 450 XP)

## Inciting Action

After arriving in the forest, they hear a child screaming. They find Onver, fleeing from "demons."

### Onver's Story

- He and his friend Shalana were in the forest picnicking (they left Lamaltee without their parent's permission) when demons attacked them.
- Demons were thin monsters blacker than midnight.
- Shalana stayed to fight them; Onver ran away.

As they talk to him, corrupted plants attack them.

**3 Twig Blights** (easy, 150 AXP, 75 XP)
- clearing (heroes), tree line (twig blights)

## Finding Shalana

Onver begs them to help him rescue Shalana. When they track down Shalana, they find she has been carried off by blighted plants. The blights are taking Shalana to the druid Avandith to be corrupted.

**3 Twig Blights, 1 Needle Blight** (medium, 250 AXP, 125 XP)
- front trees (blights), middle trees, rear trees (heroes)

## Return to Lamaltee

After rescuing Shalana, the elven children ask to be taken back to Lamaltee. However, they beg the heroes not to tell their parents about this because they weren't supposed to have left the village.

If the heroes DON'T tell the parents, have the parents drag out the truth about the blights. Then the parents ask the heroes to speak with Aelrindell Waterjump at Aubron Keep about the monsters.

**Rewards.** The parents reward the heroes as follows:
- Kurtice Sourdirt gives EACH of them 3 healing potions and 1 greater healing potion.
- Abigail Oakbow gives them 100 gp and a 10% discount in her shop in the village.

## Aubron Keep

Nasair training elves in the courtyard. He interrogates the pandas as he's suspicious of talking bears.

Aelrindell will ask them to investigate the blighted plants. Her forces are spread thin currently with issues to the southwest (kobolds), southeast (goblins), and west (spider infestation). She promises to make it worth their trouble (a reward) and try to find out how the pandas can get home.

## Milestone -- Level 2

For rescuing the children, exploring their new world, and agreeing to help the elves, the heroes gain level 2.

## Hungry Wolves

As they search and investigate the forest, they hear howling in the distance, and a pack of wolves descend upon them. Allow animal handling checks to make the wolves leave them alone (the wolves are hungry, there is little game in the corrupted part of the forest).

**5 Wolves** (medium, 500 AXP, 250 XP)
- left of stream (wolves), stream, right of stream (heroes)

## A Song and a Dance

The heroes hear music (panpipes) playing off in the distance. A drunken satyr named Zhaiket is playing panpipes in a small glade. Several empty wine flasks lie about him.

### Zhaiket interactions
- He is initially surprised by the heroes.
- He's getting drunk because his wife Vufu has been missing for days and he can't find her.
- After some banter, he asks if they have any wine.
- If they don't give him wine, he begins playing his panpipes, trying to put them to sleep. If he succeeds, he'll steal all their coins and gems and then run off.
- If the heroes best him or make friends with him somehow (perhaps they promise him wine),
