# A Guide and Sample to Developing a Quick Adventure
## Step 1: Whats the Problem?

> The Character's are somewhere and something goes wrong: an emergency, a mystery, situation worth investigating, an npc who is in need, something you need to get, something you need to deliver, someone is in some sort of danger...there is a problem in the world that the party is going to have to find out about or try to solve/make worse.

Party has to go do a job so a friend/guild member can be bought out of jail or a bad situation/get him out of a bad contract.

### What Does the Party Actually Have to Do?

Earn money to buy out the contract. -OR- Complete the stipulation of the contract to free the friend.

## Step 2: Who Needs You?

> Not only who is the party in need, but how are they related to the party? Is it a stranger, a former friend or colleague, a past lover, family, etc?

One of the party member's best friends from jail or a former job. The party member and the friend parted ways but word has passed from somewhere and the friend is reaching out again.

## Step 3: What Could Go Wrong?

>Are there physical dangers? Are there dangers of betrayal along the way?

Rival group that is also trying to buy out the contract of another contracted man. Some high up member of a different group/guild is also jailed/contracted and this rival group/guild is trying to free their boss instead. There is only one mcguffin so only one may be freed.

## Step 4: What's the Big Finish? / Where is this All Going?

> Do you have in mind what the final conflict is. Is it a race against the other party? Is it just a cave full of goblins?

It's all going to end in a dungeon. The artifact is in the deepest room of the dungeon.

## Step 5: Why Me? (An Adventurer's Plea)

> Why should the party care about this problem? If there isn't a reason in the quest itself, there needs to be a reason connected to the quest giver.
