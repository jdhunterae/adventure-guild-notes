Overall, you can let one of the three legs be weak. But think Neil Gaiman and what it takes to be successful. You **MUST** have a solid two-out-of-three.

## 1. What

> The characters going on the adventure and what motivates them. This includes the character's goal and motivation. (partly the why)

## 2. Where

> The place where the adventure happens. Could be a dungeon, a ruin, space...who knows

## 3. What

> The villain and their goals
