## Future of the saved children

Each of the children saved from the roots of the tree have been altered by the events and by being soul-linked with the
reviving Arch Lord.

### The Chipmunk King

One of the children remains in the glade that the Elven village was in. He has become a druid
to remain and keep the village safe (without realizing this is the exact path that the druid/
cultists who were trying to revive the Arch Lord had the same goal). In becoming a druid, he
has started to draw in the different animals of the forest. But he is especially connected
with the chipmunks, who serve as his eyes and ears in the forest.

If provoked, he fights as a Druid (MM) and 2 Swarm of Rats (MM). For each following round of combat,
The Chipmunk King summons more Swam of Rats (chipmunks) on a 1d20 roll if he rolls the same
as his initiative number. (still working on this skill)

His level of hostility depends on how often the party checks in on the village, and whether they
followed up on either the poisoned food stores, or the goblins living to the south.
