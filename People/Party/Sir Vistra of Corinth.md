Sir Vistra of Corinth is a human Oath of the Ancients Paladin. He is brash and overconfident in his strength. He is an unknowing follower of  [[Cayden Cailean]].

> Here's to the Bard and his knob of a head. Here's to Cailean, the stone, and our dead. When the gate is knocked in, and the world is aflame, There's no wall but us, and the pay is the fame. - *A classic Cayden Cailean toast*

## History

Raised among [[Lonmar Dwarves]] of [[Lonmar Heights]] as a foundling.

Upon coming of age at 15, he was sent down the mountain to live with the tall-folk. He was set up as a Page to the [[Duke of Corinth]], rising to the rank of Squire and now a Knight in Training. Part of the final steps of attaining knighthood is that Vistra needed to leave the dukedom and only return after attaining a great deed of heroism. He has now been serving with the Adventurer's Guild ([[Ember Swords]]) of [[Thired-upon-Sunt]], attaining the rank of "Assistant to the Captain."

Sir Vistra is a Paladin from the city state of Corinth. He was charged by his liege, the Lord of Corinth, to venture from the kingdom and spread the word of the light of Pelor.
