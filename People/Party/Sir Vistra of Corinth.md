Sir Vistra of [[Corinth]] is a human Oath of the Ancients Paladin. He is brash and overconfident in his strength. He is an unknowing follower of  [[Cayden Cailean]].

> Here's to the Bard and his knob of a head. Here's to Cailean, the stone, and our dead. When the gate is knocked in, and the world is aflame, There's no wall but us, and the pay is the fame. - *A classic [[Cayden Cailean]] toast*

## Backstory

Sir Vistra's birth parents are unknown. He was left as a foundling in the [[Lonmar Heights]]. Found by the [[Lonmar Dwarves]] and raised as one of their own.

At his coming of age, 15, Vistra's adoptive parents sent him down the mountain to [[Corinth]]. Vistra's father had enlisted him as a Squire in service of the [[Duke of Corinth]]. After a few years, rising in the ranks as a Knight in training, Vistra was sent forth from the castle to complete his training. Part of the final steps of attaining knighthood is that Vistra needed to leave the dukedom and only return after attaining a great deed of heroism.

His travels on the road offered Vistra several opportunities to aid passersby, and eventually lead him to the city of [[Thired-upon-Sunt]] where he joined the [[Ember Swords]] (the established [[Adventurer's Guild]]). Vistra again rose through the ranks over a few years, attaining the rank of "Assistant to the Captain."

Now, in his new position as "Assistant to the Captain" by [[Captain Angmar Writingham]], Vistra has been assigned to assess the applications of a new group of adventurers applying to the guild.
